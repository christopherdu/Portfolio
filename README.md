# Persona portfolio for Christopher Du @ christopherdu.com

## Intro
This repository was created last year as a way to keep my previous iteration of my peronsal portfolio organized and centralized.
I've since decieded to redo my portfolio with a new design, updating this repository.

### What I'm using
I've decided to keep the technology used for my portfolio really simple. HTML5, SASS, and vanilla JavaScript. As it will be a static website
as opposed to a dynamic website, I felt it made the most sense to keep it simple.
